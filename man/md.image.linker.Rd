\description{
Format a markdown image reference (link) to .pdf and .png versions of a graph,
and insert both links into the markdown report set by "path_of_report".
If the "b.png4GitHub" variable is set, the .png-link is set up such,
that you can upload the whole report with the .png image into your GitHub repo's wiki,
under "Reports"/OutDir/ (Reports is a literal string, OutDir is the last/deepest
directory name in the "OutDir" variable. See create_set_OutDir() function.).
This function is called by the ~wplot functions.

md.image.linker(fname_wo_ext = "MyPlot")
